# class-imbalance-effects3
This analysis explores how class imbalance and data augmentation affect classification performance using TCGA lung cancer gene expression data. Logistic regression and random forest models were trained to distinguish lung adenocarcinoma (Group A) from other lung cancer types (Group B). Starting from a 50:50 class ratio, Group A was progressively reduced while Group B remained fixed. Models were trained and tested at each step, both with and without ROSE-based augmentation. Feature selection, and coefficient variability were assessed across 185 configurations to evaluate model stability and the impact of augmentation.
